Software Architect & AI Researcher at [Indiana University's Division of Computational Pathology](https://medicine.iu.edu/pathology/research/computational-pathology), and Technical Lead at the [Medical Working Group of MLCommons](https://mlcommons.org/en/groups/research-medical/) working on designing solutions for privacy-focused AI in Healthcare.

I believe open software fosters better science, and thus have been involved in multiple open-source projects and their associated research studies, including the [Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS)](https://www.fets.ai/) platform and the [Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk)](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/captk/). I am currently focusing my efforts on the following: 

- [Federated Learning for Postoperative Segmentation of Treated glioblastoma (FL-PoST)](https://fets-ai.github.io/FL-PoST/)
- [Generally Nuanced Deep Learning Framework (GaNDLF)](https://mlcommons.github.io/GaNDLF)
- [MedPerf](https://www.medperf.org)
- [Open Federated Learning (OpenFL)](https://github.com/securefederatedai/openfl) framework
- Creating and maintaining as many [Anaconda recipes](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/) as possible
