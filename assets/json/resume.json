      "releaseDate": "2021-01-01",
      "summary": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is arguably the most aggressive, infiltrative, and heterogeneous type of adult brain tumor. Biophysical modeling of GBM growth has contributed to more informed clinical decision-making. However, deploying a biophysical model to a clinical environment is challenging since underlying computations are quite expensive and can take several hours using existing technologies. Here we present a scheme to accelerate the computation. In particular, we present a deep learning (DL)-based logistic regression model to estimate the GBM’s biophysical growth in seconds. This growth is defined by three tumor-specific parameters: 1) a diffusion coefficient in white matter (Dw), which prescribes the rate of infiltration of tumor cells in white matter, 2) a mass-effect parameter (Mp), which defines the average tumor expansion, and 3) the estimated time (T) in number of days that the tumor has been growing. Preoperative structural multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) scans from n=135\n subjects of the TCGA-GBM imaging collection are used to quantitatively evaluate our approach. We consider the mpMRI intensities within the region defined by the abnormal FLAIR signal envelope for training one DL model for each of the tumor-specific growth parameters. We train and validate the DL-based predictions against parameters derived from biophysical inversion models. The average Pearson correlation coefficients between our DL-based estimations and the biophysical parameters are 0.85 for Dw, 0.90 for Mp, and 0.94 for T, respectively. This study unlocks the power of tumor-specific parameters from biophysical tumor growth estimation. It paves the way towards their clinical translation and opens the door for leveraging advanced radiomic descriptors in future studies by means of a significantly faster parameter reconstruction compared to biophysical growth modeling approaches.",

      "summary": "Diffuse midline glioma is the leading cause of brain tumor death among the pediatric population. Drugs that show notable promise in preclinical models inevitably fail to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials, likely due to the inadequacy of preclinical models. We have recently proposed glioblastoma models derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) genetically engineered with different combinations of glioblastoma-associated genetic alterations as a platform to search for therapeutic targets. These glioblastoma avatars authentically recapitulated the different pathobiology of glioblastoma subtypes, depending on what genetic alterations to be introduced. To investigate the biology and to develop novel therapeutics for diffuse midline glioma with H3K27M mutation, we have established a novel model by introducing H3.3 K27M mutation together with one of the most common concurrent genetic alterations, TP53 R248Q mutation, into hiPSCs through CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering. Orthotopic engraftment of the neural progenitor cells derived from these edited hiPSCs formed diffusely invasive brainstem tumors with histological features of the diffuse midline glioma. These tumor avatars presented a global reduction in H3K27me3 accompanied by the expression of H3K27M. Transcriptome analyses of these models revealed that these avatars with H3K27M cluster apart from the pediatric glioma samples without this particular mutation, and that they present signatures of oligodendroglial progenitor differentiation as discovered in patient samples with this mutation. Using these models faithfully recapitulating histology and pathobiology of the patient tumors, we have performed drug screening and confirmed that their sensitivity to known drugs, including an EZH2 inhibitor and histone deacetylase inhibitors.",

      "publisher": "Academic Press",
      "releaseDate": "2020-10-15",
      "summary": "Brain extraction, or skull-stripping, is an essential pre-processing step in neuro-imaging that has a direct impact on the quality of all subsequent processing and analyses steps. It is also a key requirement in multi-institutional collaborations to comply with privacy-preserving regulations. Existing automated methods, including Deep Learning (DL) based methods that have obtained state-of-the-art results in recent years, have primarily targeted brain extraction without considering pathologically-affected brains. Accordingly, they perform sub-optimally when applied on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans with apparent pathologies such as brain tumors. Furthermore, existing methods focus on using only T1-weighted MRI scans, even though multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) scans are routinely acquired for patients with suspected brain tumors. In this study, we present a comprehensive performance evaluation of recent deep learning architectures for brain extraction, training models on mpMRI scans of pathologically-affected brains, with a particular focus on seeking a practically-applicable, low computational footprint approach, generalizable across multiple institutions, further facilitating collaborations. We identified a large retrospective multi-institutional dataset of \n mpMRI brain tumor scans, with manually-inspected and approved gold-standard segmentations, acquired during standard clinical practice under varying acquisition protocols, both from private institutional data and public (TCIA) collections. To facilitate optimal utilization of rich mpMRI data, we further introduce and evaluate a novel ‘‘modality-agnostic training’’ technique that can be applied using any available modality, without need for model retraining. Our results indicate that the modality-agnostic approach1 obtains accurate results, providing a generic and practical tool for brain extraction on scans with brain tumors.",

      "releaseDate": "2020-07-28",
      "summary": "Several studies underscore the potential of deep learning in identifying complex patterns, leading to diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Identifying sufficiently large and diverse datasets, required for training, is a significant challenge in medicine and can rarely be found in individual institutions. Multi-institutional collaborations based on centrally-shared patient data face privacy and ownership challenges. Federated learning is a novel paradigm for data-private multi-institutional collaborations, where model-learning leverages all available data without sharing data between institutions, by distributing the model-training to the data-owners and aggregating their results. We show that federated learning among 10 institutions results in models reaching 99% of the model quality achieved with centralized data, and evaluate generalizability on data from institutions outside the federation. We further investigate the effects of data distribution across collaborating institutions on model quality and learning patterns, indicating that increased access to data through data private multi-institutional collaborations can benefit model quality more than the errors introduced by the collaborative method. Finally, we compare with other collaborative-learning approaches demonstrating the superiority of federated learning, and discuss practical implementation considerations. Clinical adoption of federated learning is expected to lead to models trained on datasets of unprecedented size, hence have a catalytic impact towards precision/personalized medicine.",

      "summary": "The purpose of this manuscript is to provide an overview of the technical specifications and architecture of the Cancer imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk www.cbica.upenn.edu/captk), a cross-platform, open-source, easy-to-use, and extensible software platform for analyzing 2D and 3D images, currently focusing on radiographic scans of brain, breast, and lung cancer. The primary aim of this platform is to enable swift and efficient translation of cutting-edge academic research into clinically useful tools relating to clinical quantification, analysis, predictive modeling, decision-making, and reporting workflow. CaPTk builds upon established open-source software toolkits, such as the Insight Toolkit (ITK) and OpenCV, to bring together advanced computational functionality. This functionality describes specialized, as well as general-purpose, image analysis algorithms developed during active multi-disciplinary collaborative research studies to address real clinical requirements. The target audience of CaPTk consists of both computational scientists and clinical experts. For the former it provides i) an efficient image viewer offering the ability of integrating new algorithms, and ii) a library of readily-available clinically-relevant algorithms, allowing batch-processing of multiple subjects. For the latter it facilitates the use of complex algorithms for clinically-relevant studies through a user-friendly interface, eliminating the prerequisite of a substantial computational background. CaPTk’s long-term goal is to provide widely-used technology to make use of advanced quantitative imaging analytics in cancer prediction, diagnosis and prognosis, leading toward a better understanding of the biological mechanisms of cancer development.",

This paper presents cancer imaging phenomics toolkit (CaPTk), a new and dynamically growing software platform for analysis of radiographic images of cancer, currently focusing on brain, breast, and lung cancer. CaPTk leverages the value of quantitative imaging analytics along with machine learning to derive phenotypic imaging signatures, based on two-level functionality. First, image analysis algorithms are used to extract comprehensive panels of diverse and complementary features, such as multiparametric intensity histogram distributions, texture, shape, kinetics, connectomics, and spatial patterns. At the second level, these quantitative imaging signatures are fed into multivariate machine learning models to produce diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. Results from clinical studies in three areas are shown: (i) computational neuro-oncology of brain gliomas for precision diagnostics, prediction of outcome, and treatment planning; (ii) prediction of treatment response for breast and lung cancer, and (iii) risk assessment for breast cancer.",

      "releaseDate": "2013-02-28",
      "summary": "Visual marker based tracking is one of the most widely used tracking techniques in Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Generally, multiple square markers are needed to perform robust and accurate tracking. Various marker based methods for calibrating relative marker poses have already been proposed. However, the calibration accuracy of these methods relies on the order of the image sequence and pre-evaluation of pose-estimation errors, making the method offline. Several studies have shown that the accuracy of pose estimation for an individual square marker depends on camera distance and viewing angle. We propose a method to accurately model the error in the estimated pose and translation of a camera using a single marker via an online method based on the Scaled Unscented Transform (SUT). Thus, the pose estimation for each marker can be estimated with highly accurate calibration results independent of the order of image sequences compared to cases when this knowledge is not used. This removes the need for having multiple markers and an offline estimation system to calculate camera pose in an AR application.",
